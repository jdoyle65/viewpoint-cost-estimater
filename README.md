# ViewPoint Cost Estimator

A simple Chrome extension to do quick monthly calculations and insert them in cutsheets on https://www.viewpoint.ca

## Options

- **Downpayment (%)** - The percentage downpayment you would like to make.
- **Interest Rate (%)** - Your expected interest rate
- **Property Tax Rate (%)** - The tax rate in the municipality you expect to buy
- **Amoritization Period** - The number of years you expect your amoritization period to be
- **Estimated Monthly Utilities (optional)** - The dollar amount of your expected monthly utility costs, such as heating, electricty, internet, etc.
- **Current Monthly Costs (optional)** - Enter your current total monthly living expenses to quickly see the difference from your expected monthly costs
- **Use Assessed Value** - When calculating monthly property tax numbers the extension uses the Tax Assessed value on the cutsheet. If this value may be inaccurate, unchecking this box will instead use the sale price to calculate property taxes. This is useful for new construction, where the assessed value on the cutsheet may be the value of the land, or for partial completion of the house

## Notes

Mortgage calculations take into account CMHC default insurance rules and limits on downpayments.

## Disclaimer

This tool was built as a quick reference tool while I was house hunting on ViewPoint, and any mortgage calculations should be verified against a trusted mortgage calculator.
